- In the google_chrome role: It seems to install the google-chrome repo if the repo has not been installed.
  If the repo has already been installed then the 'install google-chrome repo' step will crash.

- in roles/dotfiles/tasks/main.yml need to add contents of files add_to_bashrc.sh to .bashrc

- Currently it seems there is an entry for /home/joseph/.composer/vendor/bin in the $PATH
  where did this come from? Try to eliminate it.

- Add the following lines to .bashrc

#load dotfiles
for DOTFILE in `find ~/.dotfiles/bashrc`
do
    [ -f "$DOTFILE" ] && source "$DOTFILE"
done

These lines load the .dotfiles/bashrc aliases, commands, and functions when the shell starts
